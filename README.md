Per the [project on Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-portfolio-project/modules/fscp-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages), this should display a random message to the user each time the page refreshes. It should also pull from at least three separate sources of information.

I wrote up [a post on Hashnode](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-portfolio-project/modules/fscp-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages), describing the process in developing my solutiuon to this project.
