Per the project on Codecademy, this should display a random message to the user each time the page refreshes. It should also pull from at least three separate sources of information. In 2021, after I first built this, I wrote up [a post on Hashnode](https://mreed.hashnode.dev/project-random-weather), describing the process in developing my solutiuon to this project.

In 2023 I refactored the project to (1) improve the functions, to (2) remove my own odd choice to rely on objects (not arrays), and (3) I added a keyboard events. When one presses space, a new message is generated--though this time its functionality is in part reliant on the JavaScript `void` operator--new to me!
