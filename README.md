# mixedMessages.js

Per the project on CodeCademy.com, this program should display a random message ot the user each time the program is ran. 

I wrote up [a post on Hashnode](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-javascript-syntax-portfolio-project/modules/fscp-mixed-messages/kanban_projects/mixed-messages), describing the process in developing my solutiuon to this project.
